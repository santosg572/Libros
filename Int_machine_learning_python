c1 introduction

machine learning is about extracting knowledge from data.
it is`a research field at the intersection of statistics artificial intelligence, and computer science and is also known as predictive
analytics or statistical learning.

using handcoded rules to make decisions has two major disadvantages
* the logic required to make a decision is specific to a single domain and task. 
   changing the task even slightly might require a rewrite of the whole system.
* designing rures requires a deep understanding of how a decision should be made by hunan expert.

will fail is in detecting faces in images


until as recently as 2001

to come up 

for an algorithm to determine what characteristics are needed to identify a face

>> problems machine learning can solve

- automate decision-makink processes by generalizing from know examples
in this setting
- supervised learning
it has never seen before
going back

are well understood
will likely 

>> examples of supervised machine learning tasks include

- identifying the zip code from handwritten digits on an evelope
- determining whether a tumor is benign based on a medical image
- detecting fraudulent activity in credit card transactions

look faily straightforward
vastly different
expensive
rare and expensive expert knowledge

they will report fraud

- unsupervised algorithms
- in unsupervised learning, only the input data is known
- they are usually harder to understand and evaluate

- examples of unsupervised learning include
1. identifying topics in a set of blog posts
2. segmenting customers into groups with similar preferences
3. detecting abnormal access patterns to a website

they created an account
they have boughht from your online shop

- each entity or row here is know as a sample 
- machine learning
- while the columns - the properties that describe these entities - are called features

we will go into more detail

you will have much better luck
