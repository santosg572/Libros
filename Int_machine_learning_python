c1 introduction

machine learning is about extracting knowledge from data.
it is`a research field at the intersection of statistics artificial intelligence, and computer science and is also known as predictive
analytics or statistical learning.

ubiquitous - ubicuo
in everyday life - en todos los días de la vida
automatic recommendations - recomendaciones automáticas
to what food to order - a que comida pedir
machine learning algorithms
core - núcleo
+
outside - fuera de
understanding stars - entendiendo estrellas
finding distant planets - encontrando planetas distantes
discovering new particles
analyzing dna sequences
personalized cancer treatments
+
in order to benefit - para beneficiarse
though - aunque
along the way - en el camino

>> why machine learning?

in the early days - En dias tempranos
adjust to user input - ajustar a la entrada del usuario
spam filter
you could make up - podrías maquillarte
blacklist - lista negra
crafting - elaboración
feasible - factible
using handcoded rules to make decisions has two major disadvantages           usando reglas codificadas a mano
* the logic required to make a decision is specific to a single domain and task. 
   changing the task even slightly might require a rewrite of the whole system.     incluso ligeramente podría requerir
* designing rules requires a deep understanding of how a decision should be made by hunan expert.

will fail is in detecting faces in images - fallará es en detectar caras en imágenes


until as recently as 2001

to come up - para subir

for an algorithm to determine what characteristics are needed to identify a face

>> problems machine learning can solve

- automate decision-makink processes by generalizing from know examples
in this setting - en esta configuración
- supervised learning
it has never seen before - nunca ha visto antes
going back - volver
as to whether - en cuanto a si
+
are well understood - son bien entendidos
will likely - probablemente

>> examples of supervised machine learning tasks include

- identifying the zip code from handwritten digits on an evelope
- determining whether a tumor is benign based on a medical image
- detecting fraudulent activity in credit card transactions

look faily straightforward - parezca falso directo
vastly different - muy diferente
expensive - costoso
rare and expensive expert knowledge - Conocimiento experto raro y costoso
privacy issues - problemas de privacidad
they will report fraud - ellos reportaran fraude

- unsupervised algorithms
- in unsupervised learning, only the input data is known
- they are usually harder to understand and evaluate

- examples of unsupervised learning include
1. identifying topics in a set of blog posts    entradas de blog
2. segmenting customers into groups with similar preferences
3. detecting abnormal access patterns to a website

they created an account - ellos crearon una cuenta
they have boughht from your online shop - Han comprado en tu tienda online.

- each entity or row here is know as a sample 
- machine learning
- while the columns - the properties that describe these entities - are called features

we will go into more detail - entraremos en más detalle

you will have much better luck - tendras mucho mejor suerte

>> knowing your task and knowing your data

- quite possibly the most important part in the machine learning process is understanding the data

what is going on in your dataset - what is going on in your dataset
setting it works best for - configurarlo funciona mejor para

>> the following questions:

1. what question(s) am i trying to answer? do i think the data colected can answer that question?
2. what is the best way to phrase my question(s) as a machine learning problem?
3. have i colected enough data to represent the problem i want to solve?
4. what features of the data did i extract, and will these enable the right predictions?
5. how will measure success in my application?
6. how will the machine learning solutiion interact with other parts of my research or business product?

- machine learning
at all times - en todo momento
when going deep into - cuando profundizamos en
it is easy to lose sight of the ultimate goals - Es fácil perder de vista los objetivos finales.
we still encourage - todavía alentamos

>> why python?

- jupyther notebook

look at shortly - mira en breve

- in which the data drives the analysis

iteration - iteración
interaction - Interacción

- creation of complex graphical user interfaces (guis) and web services

>> scikit-learn

to see what is going on behind - para ver que esta pasando detras

- it contains a number of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms

comprehensive - comprehensive

scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation

wealth - riqueza
snippets - fragmentos

scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html

thorough - completo(

>> installing scikit-learn

- numpy, scipy, matplotlib, ipython, jupyter notebook

>> anaconda (store.continuum.io/anaconda)

predictive analytics
scientific computing

1.  anaconda comes with numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, ipython, jupytherr notebook, and scikit-learn
- inter mkl library
2.  enthought canopy
3. python

>> esential libraries and tools

that will enhance - que mejorará
is built on top - está construido en la parte superior

>> jupyther notebook

- is an iteractive environment for running code in the browser.
- the jupyther notebook makes it easy to incorporate code, text, and images

github.com/amueller/introduction_to_ml_with_python

>> numpy

- it contains functionality for multidimensional arras
- high-level mathematical functions 
- the core functionality of numpy is the ndarray class
- all elements of the array must be of the same type

import numpy as np
x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print("x:\n{}".format(x))

>> scipy

- advanced linear algebra routines, mathematical function optimization, signal processing, special mathematical functions, statistical distributions
- scipy.sparse

mostly zeros

from scipy import sparse
eye = np.eye(4)
print("numpy array:\n{}".format(eye))

# convert the numpy array to a scipy sparse matrix in csr format
# only the nonzero entries are stored

sparse_matrix = sparse.csr_matrix(eye)
print("\n Scipy sparse csr matrix:\n{}".format(sparse_matrix))

>> coo format

data = np.ones(4)
row_indices = np.arrange(4)
col_indices = np.arange(4)
eye_coo = sparse.coo_matrix((data, (row_indices, col_indices)))
print("coo representation:\n{}".format(eyye_coo))

>> matplotlib

- %matplotlib notebook recomendado
- %matplotlib inline commands

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = np.linespace(-10, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)
plt.plot(x, y, marker="x")

>> pandas

wrangling - disputa
- dataframe
- sql - like queries
- joins of tables

to ingest - ingerir

- creating a dataframe using a dictionary
