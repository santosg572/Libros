c1 introduction

machine learning is about extracting knowledge from data.
it is`a research field at the intersection of statistics artificial intelligence, and computer science and is also known as predictive
analytics or statistical learning.

>> why machine learning?

in the early days
adjust to user input
spam filter

crafting
feasible
using handcoded rules to make decisions has two major disadvantages
* the logic required to make a decision is specific to a single domain and task. 
   changing the task even slightly might require a rewrite of the whole system.
* designing rures requires a deep understanding of how a decision should be made by hunan expert.

will fail is in detecting faces in images


until as recently as 2001

to come up 

for an algorithm to determine what characteristics are needed to identify a face

>> problems machine learning can solve

- automate decision-makink processes by generalizing from know examples
in this setting
- supervised learning
it has never seen before
going back
as to whether
+
are well understood
will likely 

>> examples of supervised machine learning tasks include

- identifying the zip code from handwritten digits on an evelope
- determining whether a tumor is benign based on a medical image
- detecting fraudulent activity in credit card transactions

look faily straightforward
vastly different
expensive
rare and expensive expert knowledge
privacy issues
they will report fraud

- unsupervised algorithms
- in unsupervised learning, only the input data is known
- they are usually harder to understand and evaluate

- examples of unsupervised learning include
1. identifying topics in a set of blog posts
2. segmenting customers into groups with similar preferences
3. detecting abnormal access patterns to a website

they created an account
they have boughht from your online shop

- each entity or row here is know as a sample 
- machine learning
- while the columns - the properties that describe these entities - are called features

we will go into more detail

you will have much better luck

>> knowing your task and knowing your data

- quite possibly the most important part in the machine learning process is understanding the data

what is going on in your dataset
setting it works best for

>> the following questions:

1. what question(s) am i trying to answer? do i think the data colected can answer that question?
2. what is the best way to phrase my question(s) as a machine learning problem?
3. have i colected enough data to represent the problem i want to solve?
4. what features of the data did i extract, and will these enable the right predictions?
5. how will measure success in my application?
6. how will the machine learning solutiion interact with other parts of my research or business product?

- machine learning
at all times
when going deep into
it is easy to lose sight of the ultimate goals
we still encourage

>> why python?

- jupyther notebook

look at shortly

- in which the data drives the analysis

iteration
interaction

- creation of complex graphical user interfaces (guis) and web services

>> scikit-learn

to see what is going on behind

- it contains a number of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms

comprehensive

>> installing scikit-learn

- numpy, scipy, matplotlib, ipython, jupyter notebook

>> anaconda (store.continuum.io/anaconda)

predictive analytics
scientific computing

1.  anaconda comes with numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, ipython, jupytherr notebook, and scikit-learn
- inter mkl library
2.  enthought canopy
3. python

>> esential libraries and tools

that will enhance 
is built on top

>> jupyther notebook

- is an iteractive environment for running code in the browser.
- the jupyther notebook makes it easy to incorporate code, text, and images

github.com/amueller/introduction_to_ml_with_python

>> numpy

- it contains functionality for multidimensional arras
- high-level mathematical functions 
- the core functionality of numpy is the ndarray class
- all elements of the array must be of the same type

import numpy as np
x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print("x:\n{}".format(x))

>> scipy

- advanced linear algebra routines, mathematical function optimization, signal processing, special mathematical functions, statistical distributions
- scipy.sparse

mostly zeros

from scipy import sparse
eye = np.eye
